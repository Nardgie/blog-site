# LA Tech Blog

## Description

LA Tech Blog is a CMS-style platform designed for developers and tech enthusiasts to share their insights, articles, and personal experiences in the tech industry. This project was motivated by the need for a dedicated space where technology topics can be discussed and explored in depth. Building this project allowed for practical application of full-stack development skills, focusing on user authentication, content management, and responsive web design. The main problems it solves include providing a structured, accessible way for users to publish content and engage with the community. Through this project, I've deepened my understanding of Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and SQL databases.
